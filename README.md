SugarScape
==========

An implementation of the Epstein & Axtell (1996) model SugarScape. Original
code from:

https://juliadynamics.github.io/AgentsExampleZoo.jl/dev/examples/sugarscape/

Very minor changes made by Fjalar de Haan in April 2023 to turn the tutorial
code into a Julia module that can be loaded using `using SugarScape` and
with the visualisations wrapped into functions for ease of demonstration.
